        content: "US startup Aeromine has installed the UK’s first “motionless” wind turbine atop BMW’s Mini factory in Oxford.The 3-metre-tall, box-shaped device captures wind flowing up and over the building. Specially designed wing-like airfoils create a vacuum behind the unit which forces air up through a chamber where it turns a fan inside, generating power.\_Aeromine’s device has no visible moving parts. The bladeless design minimises noise and vibrations, and the risks to wildlife like birds or bats."

Specially designed wing-like airfoils create a vacuum behind the unit which forces air up through a chamber where it turns a fan inside, generating power.&nbsp;</p><p>Aeromine’s device has no visible moving parts. The bladeless design minimises noise and vibrations, and the risks to wildlife like birds or bats.</p><p>By amplifying wind speed, Aeromine’s system can harness energy more efficiently. Each unit has a power rating of 5kW — equivalent to about 16 solar panels, but covering a much smaller area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Danish wind energy expert Carsten Westergaard patented the technology in 2015. After a number of years of R&amp;D, in 2022, he teamed up with American entrepreneurs Martin Manniche and David Asarnow to found Aeromine.&nbsp;</p><p>The startup, based in Houston, Texas, recently closed a $9mn funding round as it looks to bring its mini wind turbines to rooftops across the world. Central to that mission is securing big customers with big buildings.</p><h2>Solar power’s new best bud?</h2><p>BMW’s Oxford plant has one of the largest roof-mounted solar farms in the UK, with more than 11,000 panels covering an area the size of five football pitches.&nbsp;</p><p>“However, the solar panels are less effective during winter and evening hours when wind conditions are often strongest — presenting an opportunity for Aeromine’s wind energy unit to step in and continue generating renewable energy,” said the company in a <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/united-kingdom/article/detail/T0444782EN_GB/bmw-group-trials-wind-energy-innovation-in-uk-first?language=en_GB">statement</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>BMW will trial the wind energy device with an eye to potentially roll it out globally. The test falls under the automotive giant’s Startup Garage, a business unit dedicated to supporting early-stage companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Aeromine says its systems typically consist of 20-40 units installed on the edge of a building facing the predominant wind direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Co-founder David Asarnow previously told YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnSZ0MHIcvs">Just Have a Think</a> that once the company archives economies of scale it expects the device to produce more electricity at a cheaper cost than equivalent solar panels.</p>'
