This data gets fed to Wayve’s so-called “embodied AI” system.</p><p>Unlike many other self-driving <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> models, which have to be trained on each possible driving scenario and are confined to geofenced limits, Wayve’s AI is more free to act and learn on its own. The more the AI “drives,” the better it becomes at responding to hazards.</p>'
