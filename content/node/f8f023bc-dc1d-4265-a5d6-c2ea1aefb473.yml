The Reykjavik-based sound simulation and synthetic audio data generation <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/startups">startup</a> has just raised €11mn in <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/funding">Series A</a> to improve our audio experiences of the built environment, something increasingly proven to affect our overall wellbeing (and productivity) in spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Treble’s technology specialises in <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/mozart-and-siemens-acoustic-digital-twin">simulating sounds</a> of buildings, cars — and tech products — via a cloud-based platform. Founded in 2020 by acoustic engineers Dr Finnur Pind and Jesper Pedersen, the startup currently employs 35 people (approximately 0.009% of Iceland’s total population).&nbsp;</p><p>Having launched the platform in 2023, Treble says its mission is to “enable a better sounding world, enhancing overall wellbeing and productivity.” It does this using what it says is the world’s fastest wave-based sound simulation technology — 100 times faster than other state-of-the-art solutions.</p>'
