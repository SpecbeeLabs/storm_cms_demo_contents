It has opened calls for proposals to R&D teams across academia and industry, from universities and private labs to startups and SMEs.'

It has been <a href="https://earth.org/greenland-has-lost-1-trillion-tons-more-ice-than-previously-thought-new-study-reveals/">retreating</a> alarmingly over the last four decades, contributing to rising sea levels. If it melts completely, global sea levels would rise by about <a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-03-greenland-ice-sheet.html">7 metres</a>.</p><p>The other is the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, an oceanic current that carries relatively warm water along the coast of Norway and helps maintain a moderate climate in northern Europe. The <a href="https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-2589/egusphere-2023-2589.pdf">increasing weakening</a> of the gyre could lead to lower temperatures in the region.</p>'
