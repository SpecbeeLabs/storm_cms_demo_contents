Its aim was to test the viability of blood samples following drone transport.</p><p>To do this, the research team sent 10 identical blood packs between Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust’s Wansbeck Hospital and Alnwick Infirmary, and back again.</p><p>Five of them travelled via <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/drone">drone</a> over a 68km journey in a total of 61 minutes. The other five were transported with ground vehicles across a 74.6km route, which took 68 minutes.</p><p>The team then analysed the blood samples to test if they had maintained their quality and could be used for transfusion. They found no significant differences in the biochemical and haematological properties of the blood.</p><p>“The results of this first trial are very promising, showing no compromise to the safety of the blood,” said Gail Miflin, chief medical officer at NHS Blood and Transplant.</p><p>Following this study, the NHS is now planning a series of further trials to determine if delivering medical supplies by drone is feasible. This could potentially offer a faster and greener alternative to traditional road transport.</p><p>The next trial will focus on delivering platelets, a type of blood cell that helps form clots that can slow or stop bleeding.</p>'
