Additionally, SpaceX will demonstrate Starship’s capability to dock with Gateway, a small space station that will orbit the Moon in efforts to support both lunar and deep-space exploration, accommodate four crew members, and deliver more supplies, equipment, and science payloads that are needed for extensive surface exploration.</p><p>SpaceX’s <a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/"><strong>Starship</strong></a> spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket represent an integrated and fully reusable launch, propellant delivery, rendezvous, and planetary lander system with robust capabilities and safety features uniquely designed to deliver these essential building blocks. We are honored to be a part of NASA’s Artemis Program to help return humanity to the Moon and usher in a new era of human space exploration.</p>'
