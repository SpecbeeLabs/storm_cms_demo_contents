The French startup recently received FDA approval for Sonio Detect, a product that uses deep learning algorithms to improve the image quality of ultrasound scans in real time.&nbsp;</p><p>Sonio Detect’s <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> model is trained on over a million real ultrasound images. The software is designed to identify prenatal syndromes and abnormalities that doctor’s might’ve missed otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung Medison’s CEO, Kyu Tae Yoo, said Sonio’s software will “enhance” its ultrasound tech offerings by “improving exam quality, efficiency, and overall patient care.”&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung Medison has acquired 100% of Sonio’s shares under the deal. However, the Korean tech giant stressed that Sonio will remain an independent company headquartered in France that will “continue its commercial growth independently.” Sonio’s products will also remain compatible with all ultrasound devices, not just Samsung’s.&nbsp;</p>'
