Acknowledging that people may be hesitant to provide direct aid to military efforts, its originators wanted to find other ways in which to support Ukraine and its economy.</p><p>“This is really important, because we still need this place to be productive and to flourish — to function at the core,” Klen says. “We thought that we could still bring up Ukraine’s name in a positive context, and advertise and promote Ukrainian products and services.”</p><p>One such company is Klen’s own <a href="https://petcube.com/en-nl/">Petcube</a> — a startup that sells interactive pet monitoring devices including a vet chat feature. The company manufactures in China and has an international market, which has allowed it to keep growing despite domestic hardships.</p>'
