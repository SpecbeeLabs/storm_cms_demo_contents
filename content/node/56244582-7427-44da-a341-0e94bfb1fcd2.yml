Astronomers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2024/07/19/theres-now-10000-active-satellites-in-orbit-most-belong-to-elon-musk/">estimate</a>&nbsp;that over 10,000 active satellites were in orbit last month — four times as many as just five years ago.</p><p>The surge in launches has ignited excitement about a new space race. But the cosmic traffic may be heading for a catastrophic crash.</p><p>Back on Earth, the UK’s&nbsp;Space Operations Centre is tracking the threats with growing alarm.&nbsp;In July alone, the centre warned British satellite operators of 1,795 collision risks. Across the previous six months, almost 12,000 alerts were sent.</p><p>Yet not every accident can be averted. In 2021, a Chinese military satellite was damaged by a chunk of Russian rocket. In March, a piece of space junk smashed through <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/mystery-object-that-crashed-into-florida-home-last-month-was-discarded-space-junk-nasa-says-13116316">a Florida roof</a>.</p><p>With satellite constellations proliferating, the threat of further accidents is increasing. That’s given spacetech <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/startups">startups</a> a new focus: collision avoidance.</p><p>Europe has become fertile ground for their plans.</p><h2>The tech targeting space collisions</h2><p>Several startups have turned their attentions to space junk.</p><p>Over <a href="https://sdup.esoc.esa.int/discosweb/statistics/">130 </a>million lumps&nbsp;of trash are currently hurtling around Earth at speeds of up to 15km per second. If one of them hits a satellite, the impact can be devastating.</p><p>Spacetech offers an array of ways to tidy up the mess.</p><p>Swiss startup ClearSpace wants to use a litter-picking robot. The company&nbsp;has <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/clearspace1-launch-contract-first-ever-space-debris-removal-mission">signed a contract</a> with French rocket giant Arianespace for the debut mission.</p><p>Norway’s <a href="https://www.solstorm.io/">Solstorm</a> has an entirely different idea: harnessing solar wind energy to deorbit the junk. The startup also offers collision detection.</p><p>Spanish startup IENAI has another propulsion plan. The company harnesses <a href="https://ienai.space/">electrospray thrusters</a> to avoid collisions and de-orbit defunct satellites.</p><p>France has also produced eye-catching solutions.</p><p>One is <a href="https://www.lookupspace.com/">Look Up Space</a>, which builds radars on Earth to track junk in the skies. Another is Dark, which is constructing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/dark-space-is-building-a-rocket-powered-boxing-glove-to-push-debris-out-of-orbit/">a rocket-powered boxing glove</a> to punch debris away.</p><p>Across the German border, Munich’s <a href="https://www.vyoma.space/">Vyoma</a> concentrates on space traffic management. By combining a sensor network with real-time mapping of space, the company could reduce collision risks.</p><h2>Preparing for launch</h2><p>All these startups still need to prove their concepts work in practice. Space experts hope that happens quickly.</p><p>“The risk of collision in the most crowded orbit — 800km from Earth — is now one in 1,000,” Pascal Lecointe, a space insurance expert, said in January.</p><p>“Just a few decades ago, when there were far fewer satellites and less space debris, the risk of collision was one in 1 million. “</p><p>With satellite launches showing no signs of slowing down, Lecointe expects the threat to grow. “We’re likely to see that risk climb even more to perhaps 1 in 100 over the next decade.”</p>'
