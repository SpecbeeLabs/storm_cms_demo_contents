And it comes with all sorts of glittery extras so you can bedazzle it to your heart’s content — and relive some late-90s Barbie nostalgia.&nbsp;</p><p>The phone is also dumb. Very dumb. No social media, no apps — just good ol’ fashioned SMS and calls. But that’s the point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“It is the perfect tool to live your best life and take a vacation from your smartphone,” said its creators, Finnish company Human Mobile Devices (HMD), which built the phone in partnership with the maker of Barbie dolls, Mattel.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Barbie phone is a brick phone at heart — albeit in fancy-dress — that doesn’t mean it’s useless. It comes fitted with a 0.3-megapixel camera, which is perfect for that early old-school digital camera look. The phone runs on the S30+ operating system and comes with 128MB of internal storage — ouch. But you have the option to add a 32GB SD card if you want.&nbsp;</p><h2>Digital detox</h2><p>The launch of the Barbie phone comes amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/25/ee-warns-parents-against-giving-children-under-11-a-smartphone">growing calls</a> from parents, schools, and businesses to limit the time children spend on smartphones.&nbsp;</p><p>Some 90% of children in the UK <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2024-0103/">own a smartphone</a> by the time they turn 11. The majority of these kids also use social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9407706/">linked</a> excessive use of apps like <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/facebook">Facebook</a>, Instagram, and TikTok to an increase in cases of depression, anxiety, and diet-related issues among youth.&nbsp;</p><p>These problems aren’t just isolated to young people. Most of us would probably benefit from spending less time staring at our phones and more time connecting with the world around us.&nbsp;</p><p>The humble dumbphone can be your ticket to this digital detox. A pink Barbie dumbphone bedazzled with sequins and glitter? Even better — perhaps.</p>'
